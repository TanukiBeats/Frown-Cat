Some notes regarding this check-in:

1. Our project only concerns up to stream 10.

2. We have spoken with Dr. Curtis and because out project does not involving any rate changes, we do not need a level 2 reactor. We also don't have any separators (see above note).

3. We have two ASPEN models for the process and the utility. This was done because of the nature of the reactor.
